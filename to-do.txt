Moreno To-do:

- Fixed height and scroll on selected artists
- Text always above nodes but nodes always hoverable
- Don't recreate iframe if artist is already active
- Fix height of svg to fit vh
- Reduce width of sidebar and size of album
- Spawn new nodes at select node if it exists
- Click shouldn't cause node to start moving again
- Remove iframe when active artist is removed
- Collapsible nodes for selected artists
- Spinny thing on 1sec timeout while iframe loads
